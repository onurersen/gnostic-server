**What... is this thing?**

This is a simple web back-end to store notes (you may call "sentences") with a tagging mechanism.  
Any client can connect and create new notes via this back-end.

**Why did i create such a thing?**

I literally like to take notes during learning something, reading a book, watching a movie so on and so forth. 🗒️ 📰 🎥

Note-taking helps to remember something that we learn and that we would like to use later on. However, after using many apps, I could not find what I was looking for easy note-taking and accesing it. 🤯

I mean simple and short notes while I'm talking about taking notes... Like only one sentence (or two maybe). Short and quick notes are more reachable, understandable and storable than long ones and web urls. 😩

If I need to search something for example within my notes, I generally use keywords like I'm searching something on Google.  
So my ultimate goal is creating an application that helps me to save notes with keywords/tags and a quick searching mechanism.

**What technologies are in?**

This back-end application is created using NodeJS and MongoDB.
To keep it simple I did not include any other technologies for such functionality.  
(Sure someday it will have authentication and authorization mechanisms...)

**A little more about my note-taking journey...**

In 2015, I met with mindmapping applications. Before that I was using Apple Notes, Evernote, Microsoft OneNote etc.  
Mindmapping was super-duper useful for me to keep track of what I've learned from MOOC lessons, new technologies.  
Gradually mindmapping became my only source of knowledge that I was archiving whatever I learned.
...until I found it very difficult to open, edit and manage mindmaps in Windows, Mac on web. There should have been a better way 
for me to keep my notes. OK, mindmapping was visually satisfying but for quite less information. When your knowledge on a subject grows 
it becomes harder to manage those visually beautiful maps.  
Then I made up my mind for creating something text-based, something easy to use and acces whatever I want quickly.  

**What does gnostic mean?**

One who has knowledge of the spiritual. 🤓 🧠
